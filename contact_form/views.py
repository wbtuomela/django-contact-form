    Render a contact form, validate its input and send an email
    from it. Subclass it, if you need additional functionality.

    **Optional arguments:**

    ``fail_silently``
        If ``True``, errors when sending the email will be silently
        supressed (i.e., with no logging or reporting of any such
        errors. Default value is ``False``.

    ``form_class``
        The form to use. If not supplied, this will default to
        ``contact_form.forms.ContactForm``. If supplied, the form
        class must implement a method named ``save()`` which sends the
        email from the form; the form class must accept an
        ``HttpRequest`` as the keyword argument ``request`` to its
        constructor, and it must implement a method named ``save()``
        which sends the email and which accepts the keyword argument
        ``fail_silently``.

    ``success_url``
        The URL to redirect to after a successful submission. If not
        supplied, this will default to the URL pointed to by the named
        URL pattern ``contact_form_sent``.

    ``template_name``
        The template to use for rendering the contact form. If not
        supplied, defaults to
        :template:`contact_form/contact_form.html`.
